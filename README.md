# WordPress / Trellis / Bedrock Starter

This is a starter repo for building a bespoke WordPress site using modern dev tools.

## Philosophy

TO DO. Talk about general workflow and how things are synced and managed.
- WordPress plugins are managed using Composer

## This project consists of two parts

The WordPress CMS, Plugins, Themes and files found inside the `site` directory.

Trellis' Ansible files used to serve the `site` directory across consistent dev/stag/production environments.

The two directories have their own README's with more info.
